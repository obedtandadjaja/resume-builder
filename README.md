Resume PDF builder that I made for my college for fun

As I was searching for an internship this summer, I found it hard for me to write my own resume since I did not know what information I should put in and what is the appropriate structure of the resume. As I was looking for internships online, I found that internship.com's resume builder feature is awesome but then the resume you made is only available on that platform. For this reason, I made a close-to-exact replica of their resume builder feature but with the addition of being able to download it in PDF.

Since I can no longer invest my time in this project, I hope the school can develop this project even further and implement it in their system for the whole campus to use.

Also note that I only put in approximately 50 hours to this project and so I did not have the time to make the front-end beautiful or interesting.
